Do you want to help people get started speaking at tech conferences? That's awesome! Here's how to help!

1. Make a pull request that adds your next availability option to README.md. I love in-person and on-line options. If it's an in-person event, try to give folks around a week's worth of advance notice.
1. Promote your Speaker Jam your favorite way. Change this example "If you want to start speaking at confs, I can help! Tonight 5-6pm in Cap Hill. Brainstorm topics, proposal review! https://github.com/KatieK2/speaker-jam"
1. Help people and keep being awesome!

##Thank you!
